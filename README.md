Simple Diff is based on Diff, Match and Patch.

There are quite a few structual changes to the code. The match and patch functionality has been completely removed. There is now only a single accessible method (render). It no longer implements the original API.

The original Diff, Match and Patch library can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/)

### Usage

```javascript
simple_diff = new simple_diff()
html = simple_diff.render(text1, text2)
```

To style it just add some css for del and ins elements. For example:
```CSS
del { background-color: #ffdddd; }
ins { background-color: #ddffdd; }
```
